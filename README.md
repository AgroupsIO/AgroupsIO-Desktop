The open-source project Agroups.io is a desktop application for OSX, Linux and Windows developed entirely with javascript based on *[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)*.

With it you can in a graphical interface manage packages managers like npm (node.js), composer (php) and Bower (js).

In the future we will also implement the functionality to manage the Grunt and Karma configuration files.
